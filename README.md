# Log Analysis Project
Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nano Degree Project #3

Using the news Database provided by Udacity, the script runs 3 queries and writes the output in a textfile. 

### Install
To start on this project, you'll need database software (provided by a Linux virtual machine) and the data to analyze.

My project used the following,
* Python 3
* VirtualBox(An alternative virtual machine can be used) 
* Vagrant (To manage the VM and use the pre-provided installations by Udacity )
* Newspaper Log Database(Provided by Udacity)
* PostgreSQL

1. Install the neccessary software
2. Download/Clone this directory and move it in the Vagrant directory.
3. Bring up the VM online, log into it, and access the vagrant folder that is shared with the local computer containing the Python script.
```
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
$ cd /vagrant
```

### USAGE

After going through the installation, run the following command from a command line. 
```
$ python log_analysis.py
```


	
### Issues
Feel free to reach out to me if there are any issues with the script.
